            <p> In this project completed for COGS 108, my group explored the impact of the increase in the average recorded temperature in California
                from the span of 2000-2017 on the wildfires recorded in California. We found a correlation between rising temperatures and the number
                of wildires as well as the number of total acres burned by the wildfires.
